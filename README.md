## Quick introduction to Swashbuckle and NSwag

This repository contains a series of basic steps for integrating Swagger .NET tooling, that is Swashbuckle and NSwag, into new projects.

Follow the [git commits](https://github.com/CaringDev/SwaggerDemo/commits/master) in `master` to get an idea of how to proceed.
Note that I will do `push --force` whenever needed.
